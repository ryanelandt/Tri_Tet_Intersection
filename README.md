This packages computes intersections between triangles and tetrahedrons. Basic geometry functions for triangles and tetrahedrons are also included.

The intersection algorithm is the Sutherlandâ€“Hodgman algorithm implemented in tetrahedral coordinates.
This algorithm clips the triangle with the planes of the tetrahedron leaving only the parts of the triangle that lie within the tetrahedron.
